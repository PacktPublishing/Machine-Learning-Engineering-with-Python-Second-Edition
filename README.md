# Errata

## Page 52 - Package management (conda and pip)
In page 52 the text reads :
_"First, if we want to create a conda environment called mleng with Python version 3.8 installed, we simply execute the following in our terminal:_ 
```console
conda env --name mleng python=3.10
```
creating a Conda environment called mleng with Python version 3.8, but the command specifies python=3.10.
To align with the intended version, the correct text should be: 

**First, if we want to create a conda environment called mleng with Python version 3.10 installed**
